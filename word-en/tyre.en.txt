(British tyre) 
▶noun a rubber covering, typically inflated or surrounding an inflated inner tube, placed around a wheel to form a flexible contact with the road. 
• a strengthening band of metal fitted around the rim of a wheel. ORIGIN late 15th century (denoting the curved pieces of iron plate with which carriage wheels were formerly shod): perhaps a shortening of attire (because the tire was the “clothing” of the wheel).
