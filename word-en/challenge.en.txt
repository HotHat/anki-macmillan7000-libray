USAGE
challenged The use of challenged with a preceding adverb (e.g., physically challenged, originally intended to give a more positive tone than such terms as disabled or handicapped) arose in the US in the 1980s. Despite the originally serious intention, the term rapidly became stalled by uses whose intention was to make fun of the attempts at euphemism and whose tone was usually clearly ironic: examples include cerebrally challenged (not very smart), follicularly challenged (bald or balding), vertically challenged (short), etc.Usage notes show additional guidance on finer points of English usage.
