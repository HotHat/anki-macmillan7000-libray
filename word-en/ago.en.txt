USAGE
ago When ago is followed by a clause, the clause is normally introduced by that rather than since:it was sixty years ago that I left this place (not it was sixty years ago since I left this place). The use of since is redundant and is not correct in standard English.Usage notes show additional guidance on finer points of English usage.
