ago 
əˈɡō

▶adverb (used after a measurement of time) before the present; earlier: he went five minutes ago 
as long ago as 1942 
not long ago he came across a rattlesnake outside his house. ORIGIN Middle English ago, agone, past participle of the obsolete verb ago ‘pass,’ used to express passage of time. usage: When ago is followed by a clause, the clause is normally introduced by that rather than since: it was sixty years ago that I left this place (not it was sixty years ago since I left this place). The use of since is redundant and is not correct in standard English.
