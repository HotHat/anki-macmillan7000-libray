ˌtrānəˈbilitē 
noun. trainable 
ˈtrānəb(ə)l 
adjectiveORIGIN Middle English (as a noun in the sense ‘delay’): from Old French train (masculine), traine (feminine), from trahiner (verb), from Latin trahere ‘pull, draw.’ Early noun senses were ‘trailing part of a robe’ and ‘retinue’; the latter gave rise to ‘line of traveling people or vehicles,’ later ‘a connected series of things.’ The early verb sense ‘cause (a plant) to grow in a desired shape’ was the basis of the sense ‘educate, instruct, teach.’
