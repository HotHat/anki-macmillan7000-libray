1 The adverb well is often used in combination with past participles to form compound adjectives: well-adjusted, well-intentioned, well-known, and so on. As far as hyphenation is concerned, there are three general rules: (1) if the compound adjective is placed before the noun (i.e., in the attributive position), it should be hyphenated ( a well-intentioned remark); (2) if the compound adjective is preceded by an adverb ( much, very, surprisingly, etc.), the compound adjective is open ( a thoroughly well prepared student); (3) if the compound adjective is placed after the noun or verb (i.e., in the predicate position), it may, but need not, be hyphenated ( her remark was well-intentioned or her remark was well intentioned). Likewise, other, similar compounds with better, best, ill, little, lesser, least, etc., are hyphenated before the noun ( a little-known author), often open after a noun or verb ( the author was little known), and open if modified by an adverb ( a very little known author).
