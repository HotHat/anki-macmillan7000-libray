since 
sins

▶preposition, conjunction, & adverb
1 in the intervening period between (the time mentioned) and the time under consideration, typically the present: [as preposition] : she has suffered from depression since she was sixteen 
the worst property slump since the war 
[as conjunction] : I've felt better since I've been here 
[as adverb] : she ran away on Friday and we haven't seen her since.
2 [conjunction] for the reason that: because: delegates were delighted, since better protection of rhino reserves will help protect other rare species.
3 [adverb] ago: the settlement had vanished long since. ORIGIN late Middle English: contraction of obsolete sithence, or from dialect sin (both from dialect sithen ‘thereupon, afterward, ever since’). usage: When using since as a causal conjunction to mean ‘because’ or ‘given that,’ be aware that in some contexts or constructions the word may be construed as referring to time. For example, in the sentence, Since Mrs. Jefferson moved to Baltimore in the 1990s, she was not aware of the underlying complexities, it is not clear, especially at the beginning, whether since means ‘because’ or ‘from the time when.’ It is often better to simply say ‘because,’ if that is the intended meaning.
