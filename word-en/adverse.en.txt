adverse weather conditions. ORIGIN late Middle English: from Old French advers, from Latin adversus ‘against, opposite,’ past participle of advertere, from ad- ‘to’ + vertere ‘to turn.’ Compare with averse . usage: Adverse means ‘hostile, unfavorable, opposed,’ and is usually applied to situations, conditions, or events—not to people: the dry weather has had an adverse effect on the garden. Averse is related in origin and also has the sense of ‘opposed,’ but is usually employed to describe a person's attitude: I would not be averse to making the repairs myself. See also usage at averse .
