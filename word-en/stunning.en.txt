2 she was looking stunning. See beautiful. REFLECTIONS David Auburnstunning Stunning is probably the most overused synonym for 'very good,' especially in movie ads and book blurbs. When was the last time you went to a movie and saw a performance that actually stunned you—i.e., rendered you unconscious or semiconscious? Use of the word in this context has become not only an empty cliché but also annoyingly counterintuitive: wouldn't you be more likely to feel stunned by something bad than by something good? If you insist on using this word, try reversing the polarity and making it an insult. Abraham Lincoln, for example, knew how to use stun so that it really did retain the force of a blunt object—as when he contemptuously described General Rosecrans after a losing battle: ”Confused and stunned, like a duck that's been hit on the head.”Conversational, opinionated, and idiomatic, these Word Notes are an opportunity to see a working writer's perspective on a particular word or usage.
