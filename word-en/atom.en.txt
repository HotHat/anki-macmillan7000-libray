atom 
ˈadəm

▶noun the basic unit of a chemical element. 
• atoms as a source of nuclear energy: the power of the atom. 
• [usually with negative] an extremely small amount of a thing or quality: I shall not have one atom of strength left. An atom, roughly 10−8 cm in diameter, consists of a tiny, dense, positively charged nucleus made of neutrons and protons, surrounded by a cloud of negatively charged electrons. Each chemical element consists of atoms that possess a characteristic number of protons. Atoms are held together in molecules by sharing electrons. ORIGIN late 15th century: from Old French atome, via Latin from Greek atomos ‘indivisible,’ based on a- ‘not’ + temnein ‘to cut.’
