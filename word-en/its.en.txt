its

▶poss. det. belonging to or associated with a thing previously mentioned or easily identified: turn the camera on its side 
he chose the area for its atmosphere. 
• belonging to or associated with a child or animal of unspecified sex: a baby in its mother's womb. usage: Its is the possessive form of it ( the dog licked its paw), while it's is the contraction of it is ( look, it's a dog licking its paw) or it has ( it's been too long). The apostrophe in it's never denotes a possessive. The confusion is understandable, since other possessive forms (singular nouns) do take an apostrophe + s, as in the girl's bike or the president's smile.
