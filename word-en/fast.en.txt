PHRASES
pull a fast one informal try to gain an unfair advantage: Joey pulled a fast one on us.ORIGIN Old English fæst ‘firmly fixed, steadfast’ and fæste ‘firmly, securely’ In Middle English the adverb developed the senses ‘strongly, vigorously’ (compare with run hard), and ‘close, immediate’ (just surviving in the archaic and poetic fast by; compare with hard by), hence ‘closely, immediately’ and ‘quickly’; the idea of rapid movement was then reflected in adjectival use.
