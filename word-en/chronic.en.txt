USAGE
chronic Chronic is often used to mean ‘habitual, inveterate’ (e.g., a chronic liar). Some consider this use incorrect. The precise meaning of chronic is ‘persisting for a long time,’ and it is used chiefly of illnesses or other problems: more than one million people in the US have chronic bronchitis.Usage notes show additional guidance on finer points of English usage.
