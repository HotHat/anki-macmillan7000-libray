USAGE
saving, savings Use savings in the modifying position (savings bank, savings bond) and when referring to money saved in a bank: your savings are fully insured. When speaking of an act of saving, as when one obtains a discount on a purchase, the preferred form is saving:with this coupon you will receive a saving of $3 (not a savings of $3).Usage notes show additional guidance on finer points of English usage.
