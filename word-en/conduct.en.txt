nounORIGIN Middle English: from Old French, from Latin conduct- ‘brought together,’ from the verb conducere. The term originally denoted some provision for safe passage, such as an escort or pass, surviving in safe conduct; later the verb sense ‘lead, guide’ arose, hence ‘manage’ and ‘management’ (late Middle English), later ‘management of oneself, behavior’ (mid 16th century). The original form of the word was conduit, which was preserved only in the sense ‘channel’ (see conduit); in all other uses the spelling was influenced by Latin.
