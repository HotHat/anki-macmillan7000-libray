album 
ˈalbəm

▶noun
1 a blank book for the insertion of photographs, stamps, or pictures: the wedding pictures had pride of place in the family album.
2 a collection of recordings issued as a single item on CD, record, or another medium. ORIGIN early 17th century: from Latin, neuter of albus ‘white’ used as a noun meaning ‘a blank tablet.’ Taken into English from the German use of the Latin phrase album amicorum ‘album of friends,’ it was originally used consciously as a Latin word with Latin inflections.
