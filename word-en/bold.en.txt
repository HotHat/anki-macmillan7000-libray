Both words suggest assertive, confident behavior that is a little on the shameless side, but bold has a wider range of application. It can suggest self-confidence that borders on impudence (to be so bold as to call the president by his first name), but it can also be used to describe a daring temperament that is either courageous or defiant (a bold investigator who would not give up). Aggressive behavior, on the other hand, usually falls within a narrower range, somewhere between menacing (aggressive attacks on innocent villagers) and just plain pushy (an aggressive salesperson). Brazen implies a defiant lack of modesty (a brazen stare), and presumptuous goes even further, suggesting overconfidence to the point of causing offense (a presumptuous request for money). Bumptious behavior can also be offensive, but it is usually associated with the kind of cockiness that can't be helped (a bumptious young upstart). An audacious individual is bold to the point of recklessness (an audacious explorer), which brings it very close in meaning to intrepid, suggesting fearlessness in the face of the unknown (the intrepid settlers of the Great Plains).These notes show fine distinctions in meaning between closely related synonyms to help you find the best word.
