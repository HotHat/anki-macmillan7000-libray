But just how you go about announcing something depends on what you're trying to convey. If you want to make sure no one misses your message, use blazon (signs along the highway blazoned the local farmers' complaints). If you plan to make your views known to the general public through the medium of writing, use publish (to publish a story on drunk driving in the local newspaper). Use proclaim if you have something of great importance that you want to announce very formally and officially (proclaim a national day of mourning). Although declare also implies a very formal announcement (declare war), it can refer to any clear and explicit statement (declare one's love). Promulgate is usually associated with the communication of a creed, doctrine, or law (promulgate the views of the Communist Party).These notes show fine distinctions in meaning between closely related synonyms to help you find the best word.
