This is not quite the case. A feeling is more likely to be described as amazing, while ignorance is more likely to be astonishing—you won’t necessarily be wrong if you switch these adjectives, but you run the risk of making your prose sound awkward. For instance, amazing is often found modifying the words experience and job, and should you attempt to shoehorn one of its lesser-used synonyms into its place you can easily run into trouble—the phrases "I had a staggering experience last weekend" or "I did a stupefying job on my term paper" likely will have different connotations to many people than is intended. Don’t give yourself away to the first twenty-five-cent synonym that bats its eyes at you—roll the words around in your mouth to see if they’ll sound natural before choosing one.Conversational, opinionated, and idiomatic, these Word Notes are an opportunity to see a working writer's perspective on a particular word or usage.
