ˈkerət

▶noun
1 a tapering orange-colored root eaten as a vegetable.
2 the cultivated feathery-leaved plant of the parsley family that yields this vegetable. [Daucus carota, family Umbelliferae: two subspecies and many varieties; wild forms lack the swollen root.]
3 an offer of something enticing as a means of persuasion (often contrasted with the threat of something punitive or unwelcome): carrots will promote cooperation over the environment far more effectively than sticks. [with allusion to the proverbial encouragement of a donkey to move by enticing it with a carrot.] ORIGIN late 15th century: from French carotte, from Latin carota, from Greek karōton .
