ˌmēlz än ˈ(h)wēlz 
meals delivered to elderly people or invalids who are unable either to prepare meals or have meals otherwise provided.ORIGIN Old English mǣl (also in the sense ‘measure,’ surviving in words such as piecemeal ‘measure taken at one time’), of Germanic origin. The early sense of meal involved a notion of fixed time; compare with Dutch maal ‘meal, (portion of) time’ and German Mal ‘time,’ Mahl ‘meal,’ from an Indo-European root meaning ‘to measure.’
