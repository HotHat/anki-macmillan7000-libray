REFLECTIONS David Lehmansenior "Commencement" They're calling old people seniors short for senior citizens but it's as though they're still in college and can look forward to graduate school at Purgatory State or the University of the Damned and I can see this poem is intent on being Catholic though it started out agnostic Maybe that's because I was talking to Ed Webster on the phone tonight and he described himself as an agnostic who got a job teaching at a Catholic school in the South Bronx or maybe because I was reading the classifieds in the Daily News today and several greeted dead ones in heaven in any case I like seniors maybe the rest of us are juniors and sophomores and we still have the junior prom and all that romantic angst to go through before we reach the holy land.Conversational, opinionated, and idiomatic, these Word Notes are an opportunity to see a working writer's perspective on a particular word or usage.
