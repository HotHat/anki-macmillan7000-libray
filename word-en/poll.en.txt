noun poll ( sense
1 of the verb) ORIGIN Middle English (in the sense ‘head’): perhaps of Low German origin. The original sense was ‘head,’ and hence ‘an individual person among a number,’ from which developed the sense ‘number of people ascertained by counting of heads’ and then ‘counting of heads or of votes’ (17th century).
