USAGE
access The verb access is standard and common in computing and related terminology (employees can access the office network). But its use outside computing contexts, although well established in the language, is sometimes criticized as being ‘jargon’ (we lacked adequate supply to access the markets we needed to reach). Other words or phrases such as ‘enter’ or ‘gain access to’ are suggested as ready substitutes.Usage notes show additional guidance on finer points of English usage.
