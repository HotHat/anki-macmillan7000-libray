• (Thursdays) on Thursdays; each Thursday: the column is published Thursdays. ORIGIN Old English Thu(n)resdæg ‘day of thunder,’ named after Thunor or Thor, the Germanic god of thunder; translation of late Latin Jovis dies ‘day of Jupiter,’ Thor being equated with the Roman god Jupiter. Compare with Dutch donderdag and German Donnerstag . The days of the week in ancient Rome were named after the planets, which in turn were named after gods. In most cases the Germanic names substituted the name of a comparable Germanic god for the Roman god's name.
