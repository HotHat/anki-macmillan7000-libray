But this is too bad. Whilst shares with certain other nearly archaic words— relict and whilom, for example—an attractive period flavor. It calls to mind keepsake albums, rose bowers, and afternoon tea. Forgotten Edwardian novels might well open with sentences like “Whilst Lady Gwendolen …”—and the modern reader can immediately descry, if ever so faintly, the red velvet settee upon which the pouting young girl reclines, quietly sulking because Reginald is late again with the landau.
