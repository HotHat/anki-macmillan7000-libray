əˈmōSH(ə)n

▶noun a natural instinctive state of mind deriving from one's circumstances, mood, or relationships with others: she was attempting to control her emotions

• instinctive or intuitive feeling as distinguished from reasoning or knowledge: responses have to be based on historical insight, not simply on emotion. ORIGIN mid 16th century (denoting a public disturbance or commotion): from French émotion, from émouvoir ‘excite,’ based on Latin emovere, from e- (variant of ex-)‘out’ + movere ‘move.’ The sense ‘mental agitation’ dates from the mid 17th century, the current general sense from the early 19th century.
