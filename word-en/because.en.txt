PHRASES
because of on account of; by reason of: they moved here because of the baby.ORIGIN Middle English: from the phrase by cause, influenced by Old French par cause de ‘by reason of.’ usage:
1 When because follows a negative construction, the meaning can be ambiguous. In the sentence he did not go because he was ill, for example, it is not clear whether it means either ‘the reason he did not go was that he was ill’ or ‘being ill was not the reason for his going—there was another reason.’ Some usage guides recommend using a comma when the first interpretation is intended ( he did not go, because he was ill) and no comma where the second interpretation is intended, but in general it is probably safest to try to avoid such constructions altogether.
2 As with other conjunctions such as but and and, it is still widely believed and taught that it is incorrect to begin a sentence with because. It has, however, long been used in this way in both written and spoken English (typically for rhetorical effect), and it is quite correct—however, the sentence-opening because should be used sparingly. See also usage at and.3 On the construction the reason … is because, see usage at reason.4 On the use of since in the sense of because, see usage at since .
