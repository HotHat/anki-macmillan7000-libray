rely 
rəˈlī

▶verb (relies, relying, relied) [no object] (rely on/upon) depend on with full trust or confidence: I know I can rely on your discretion. 
• be dependent on: the charity has to rely entirely on public donations. ORIGIN Middle English: from Old French relier ‘bind together,’ from Latin religare, from re- (expressing intensive force) + ligare ‘bind.’ The original sense was ‘gather together,’ later ‘turn to, associate with,’ whence ‘depend upon with confidence.’
