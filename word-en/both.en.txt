PHRASES
have it both ways benefit from two incompatible ways of thinking or behaving: countries cannot have it both ways: the cost of a cleaner environment may sometimes be fewer jobs.ORIGIN Middle English: from Old Norse báthir . usage: When both is used in constructions with and, the structures following ‘both’ and ‘and’ should be symmetrical in well-formed English. Thus, studies of zebra finches, both in the wild and in captivity is stronger and clearer than studies of zebra finches, both in the wild and captivity. In the second example, the symmetry or parallelism of ‘in the wild’ and ‘in captivity’ has been lost.
