rhetoric 
ˈredərik

▶noun the art of effective or persuasive speaking or writing, especially the use of figures of speech and other compositional techniques. 
• language designed to have a persuasive or impressive effect on its audience, but often regarded as lacking in sincerity or meaningful content: all we have from the opposition is empty rhetoric.
