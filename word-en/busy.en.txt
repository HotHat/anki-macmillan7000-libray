Busy implies actively and attentively involved in work or a pastime (too busy to come to the phone). It can also be used to describe intensive activity of any kind (a busy intersection; a busy day). Someone who is engaged is also busy, but in a more focused way (engaged in compiling a dictionary). Diligent is used to describe earnest and constant effort, and it often connotes enjoyment of or dedication to what one is doing (diligent efforts to rescue injured animals). To be industrious is to be more focused still, often with a definite goal in mind (an industrious employee working for a promotion). Sedulous also applies to goal-oriented activity, but it suggests more close care and perseverance than industrious does (a sedulous investigation of the accident). The award for concentrated effort goes to the person who is assiduous, which suggests painstaking preoccupation with a specific task (the assiduous student is the one most likely to produce exemplary work).These notes show fine distinctions in meaning between closely related synonyms to help you find the best word.
