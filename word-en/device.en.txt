PHRASES
leave someone to their own devices leave someone to do as they wish without supervision.ORIGIN Middle English: from Old French devis, based on Latin divis- ‘divided,’ from the verb dividere. The original sense was ‘desire or intention,’ found now only in leave a person to his or her own devices (which has become associated with sense 2).
