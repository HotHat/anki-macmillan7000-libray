nounORIGIN Middle English: perhaps originally an alteration of Old Norse úlíkr; compare with Old English ungelīc ‘not of the same kind, not comparable.’ usage: The use of unlike as a conjunction, as in she was behaving unlike she'd ever behaved before, is not considered standard English. It can be avoided by using as with a negative instead: she was behaving as she'd never behaved before.
