REFLECTIONS David Foster Wallaceas A lot of American students like using as to mean since or because, because they think it makes their prose look classier (as Dostoevsky is so firmly opposed to nihilism, it should come as no surprise that he often presents his novels' protagonists with moral dilemmas). For really knowledgeable readers, the causal as is acceptable only in British English, and even there it's OK only if the dependent as-clause comes at the start of the sentence, since if it comes in the middle the as can look temporal and cause confusion (e.g., I declined her offer as I was on my way to the bank already).Conversational, opinionated, and idiomatic, these Word Notes are an opportunity to see a working writer's perspective on a particular word or usage.
