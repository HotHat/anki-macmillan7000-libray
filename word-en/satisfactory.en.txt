nounORIGIN late Middle English (in the sense ‘leading to the atonement of sin’): from Old French satisfactoire or medieval Latin satisfactorius, from Latin satisfacere ‘to content’ (see satisfy). The current senses date from the mid 17th century. usage: The adjectives satisfactory and satisfying are closely related (both deriving from the Latin satis ‘enough’ + facere ‘to make’), but there is an important distinction. Satisfactory denotes the meeting or fulfillment of expectations, standards, or requirements: the car's satisfactory performance in its first three road tests. Satisfying denotes the same, but goes further to connote the pleasure or enjoyment derived from the satisfaction: it was a satisfying one-dish meal.
