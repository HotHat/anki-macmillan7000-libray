USAGE
hang, hanged, hung In modern English, hang has two past tense and past participle forms: hanged and hung. Hung is the normal form in most general uses (they hung out the wash; she hung around for a few minutes; he had hung the picture over the fireplace), but hanged is the form normally used in reference to execution by hanging (she was hanged as a witch in April 1621).Usage notes show additional guidance on finer points of English usage.
