By around 1775, however, the present distinction in use had become established. At that time, borne became the standard past participle used in all the senses listed in this dictionary entry, e.g., she has borne you another son, the findings have been borne out, and so on. Born became restricted to just one very common use (which remains the case today), in the passive, without by, as the standard, neutral way to refer to birth: she was born in 1965, he was born lucky, or I was born and bred in Boston.
