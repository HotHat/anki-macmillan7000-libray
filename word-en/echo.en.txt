A delay is one or more distinct repetitions. A slapback is one distinct echo. Doubling is one echo too immediate to be heard distinctly. Chorus, flange, and phasing are one quick echo (doubling) at varying speeds, producing a whooshing or wobbling sound. Ambience, or room tone, is many quick echoes blended into an illusion of small space. Reverb is many echoes blended into an illusion of cavernous space.Conversational, opinionated, and idiomatic, these Word Notes are an opportunity to see a working writer's perspective on a particular word or usage.
