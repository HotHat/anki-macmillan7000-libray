nounORIGIN Middle English loos ‘free from bonds,’ from Old Norse lauss, of Germanic origin; related to Dutch and German los . usage: The adjective loose, meaning ‘not tight,’ should not be confused with the verb loose, which means ‘let go’: they loosed the reins and let the horse gallop. This verb in turn should not be confused with the verb lose, which means ‘be deprived of, fail to keep’: I will lose my keys if I don't mend the hole in my pocket.
