PHRASES
in bulk

2 (of a cargo or commodity) loose; not packaged: sugar is imported in bulk and bagged on the island.ORIGIN Middle English: the senses ‘cargo as a whole’ and ‘heap, large quantity’ (the earliest recorded) are probably from Old Norse búlki ‘cargo’; the origin of other senses remains uncertain, perhaps arising by alteration of obsolete bouk ‘belly, body.’ The original senses are also reflected in the phrases break bulk and in bulk.
