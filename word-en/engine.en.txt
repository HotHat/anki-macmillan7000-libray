DERIVATIVES engined adjective [in combination] : a twin-engined helicopter. engineless adjectiveORIGIN Middle English (formerly also as ingine): from Old French engin, from Latin ingenium ‘talent, device,’ from in- ‘in’ + gignere ‘beget’; compare with ingenious. The original sense was ‘ingenuity, cunning’ (surviving in Scots as ingine), hence ‘the product of ingenuity, a plot or snare,’ also ‘tool, weapon,’ later specifically denoting a large mechanical weapon; whence a machine (mid 17th century), used commonly later in combinations such as steam engine, internal combustion engine.
