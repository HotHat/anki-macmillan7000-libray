ˈso͞oniSH 
adverbORIGIN Old English sōna ‘immediately.’ usage: In standard English, the phrase no sooner is followed by than, as in we had no sooner arrived than we had to leave. This is because sooner is a comparative, and comparatives are followed by than ( earlier than; better than, etc.). It is incorrect to follow no sooner with when rather than than, as in we had no sooner arrived when we had to leave.
