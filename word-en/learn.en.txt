noun. learnable adjectiveORIGIN Old English leornian ‘learn’ (in Middle English also ‘teach’), of West Germanic origin; related to German lernen, also to lore1 . usage: In modern standard English, it is wrong to use learn to mean teach, as in that'll learn you (correct use is that'll teach you). This meaning has been recorded since the 13th century and has been used by writers such as Spenser, Bunyan, and Samuel Johnson, but it fell into disfavor in the early 19th century and is now found only in nonstandard and dialect use.
