inn 
in

▶noun an establishment providing accommodations, food, and drink, especially for travelers. 
• [usually in names] a restaurant or bar, typically one in the country, in some cases providing accommodations: the Waterside Inn. ORIGIN Old English (in the sense ‘dwelling place, lodging’): of Germanic origin; related to in. In Middle English the word was used to translate Latin hospitium (see hospice), denoting a house of residence for students: this sense is preserved in the names of some buildings formerly used for this purpose, notably Gray's Inn and Lincoln's Inn, two of the Inns of Court. The current sense dates from late Middle English.
