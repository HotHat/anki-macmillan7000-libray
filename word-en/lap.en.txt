noun (plural lapfuls) ORIGIN Old English læppa, of Germanic origin; related to Dutch lap,German Lappen ‘piece of cloth.’ The word originally denoted a fold or flap of a garment (compare with lapel), later specifically one that could be used as a pocket or pouch, or the front of a skirt when held up to catch or carry something (Middle English), hence the area between the waist and knees as a place where a child could be nursed or an object held.
