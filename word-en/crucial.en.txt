nounORIGIN early 18th century (in the sense ‘cross-shaped’): from French, from Latin crux, cruc- ‘cross.’ The sense ‘decisive’ is from Francis Bacon's Latin phrase instantia crucis ‘crucial instance,’ which he explained as a metaphor from a crux or fingerpost marking a fork at a crossroad; Newton and Boyle took up the metaphor in experimentum crucis ‘crucial experiment.’ usage: Crucial is used in formal contexts to mean ‘decisive, critical’: the testimony of the only eyewitness was crucial to the case. Its broader use to mean ‘very important’ should be restricted to informal contexts: it is crucial to get good light for your photographs.
