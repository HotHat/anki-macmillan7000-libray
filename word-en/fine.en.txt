ANTONYMS badly.REFLECTIONS Joshua Ferrisfine In its adjectival form, fine most frequently means something 'of superior quality; very good of its kind.' As a noun, it has a contrary meaning: 'a fee, a penalty.' Similarly, both meanings of the word citation (a near-synonym of fine) oppose each other: a citation can be 'a summons to appear in court,' usually to face some punitive measure, and it can mean 'an award or commendation for outstanding service or devotion to duty.' Cleave is another. There are two common verb forms of cleave, the first 'to split, separate, or sever,' and the second 'to stick fast, adhere, or cling to.' I see something similar in the word refrain: the verb form means 'to put a restraint or check on,' while the noun form indicates something recurring or repeating. I’m sure there are many other words that denote their opposites, but I can’t think of any more right now.Conversational, opinionated, and idiomatic, these Word Notes are an opportunity to see a working writer's perspective on a particular word or usage.
