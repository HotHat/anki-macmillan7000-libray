If something that is obsolete or ineffective is replaced by something that is superior, more up-to-date, or more authoritative, the correct verb is supersede (the computer superseded the electric typewriter). In contrast, displace suggests that someone or something has been ousted or dislodged forcibly, without necessarily implying that it was inferior or ineffective (a growing number of workers were being displaced by machines). Supplant is more restricted in meaning; it suggests displacement by force, fraud, or innovation (the democratic government had been supplanted by a power-hungry tyrant). It can also mean to uproot or wipe out (the English immigrants gradually supplanted the island's native inhabitants).These notes show fine distinctions in meaning between closely related synonyms to help you find the best word.
