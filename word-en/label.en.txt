The meanings have changed over time. A liberal in the late 19th century, for example, might be called a 'free-market conservative' today. Today’s progressive calling for more grassroots activism would loathe the top-down, scientific 'city-managers' championed by early 20th-century progressives. Historians often define their terminology in long footnotes. Blogs, newspaper articles, and novels do not have the space to do so. Comparisons between the personalities of today and yesteryear are fun. (Ex: Is Obama more a Teddy or Franklin Roosevelt progressive? Will he be more a Rough Rider or a Yalta statesman in the Middle East?) But they should be received with a grain of salt.Conversational, opinionated, and idiomatic, these Word Notes are an opportunity to see a working writer's perspective on a particular word or usage.
