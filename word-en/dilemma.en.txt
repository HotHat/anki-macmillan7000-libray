USAGE
dilemma At its core, a dilemma is a situation in which a difficult choice has to be made between two or more alternatives (this is my dilemma: do I stay here for the job security, or do I risk it all for the chance of a better career? ). More informally, dilemma can mean ‘a difficult situation or problem’ (as in the insoluble dilemma of adolescence). Some traditionalists object to this weakened use, but it is recorded as early as the first part of the 17th century, and is now widespread and generally acceptable.Usage notes show additional guidance on finer points of English usage.
