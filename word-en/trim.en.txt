ˈtrimnəs 
nounORIGIN Old English trymman, trymian ‘make firm, arrange,’ of which the adjective appears to be a derivative. The word's history is obscure; current verb senses date from the early 16th century when usage became frequent and served many purposes: this is possibly explained by spoken or dialect use in the Middle English period not recorded in extant literature.
