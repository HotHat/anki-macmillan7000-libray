nounORIGIN late 16th century: diminutive of Jock ‘ordinary man; a rustic,’ Scots form of the given name Jack. The word came to mean ‘mounted courier,’ hence the current sense (late 17th century). Another early use ‘horse dealer’ (long a byword for dishonesty) probably gave rise to the verb sense ‘manipulate,’ whereas the main verb sense probably relates to the behavior of jockeys maneuvering for an advantageous position during a race.
