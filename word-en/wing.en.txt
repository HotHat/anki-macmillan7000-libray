PHRASES
wing it informal if you don't know all the words, just wing it: improvise, play it by ear, extemporize, ad lib, fly by the seat of one's pants, fake it. REFLECTIONS Joshua Ferriscanceleer This lovely word is specific to the hawk: it means 'to turn once or twice on the wing before attacking.' I like it for its sound— can-sah-leer —but also for all the work that little word performs. One pictures the hawk in the air, sturdy, graceful, circling, then swooping down with fierce purpose. Canceleer can be both noun and verb, and wouldn’t it be nice to use it metaphorically, to describe that time of graceful preparation before one takes decisive action?Conversational, opinionated, and idiomatic, these Word Notes are an opportunity to see a working writer's perspective on a particular word or usage.
