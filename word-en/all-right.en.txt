2 used to emphasize how certain one is about something: “Are you sure it's him?” “It's him all right.” 
▶exclam. expressing or asking for assent, agreement, or acceptance: all right, I'll tell you. usage: The merging of all and right to form the one-word spelling alright is first recorded toward the end of the 19th century (unlike other similar merged spellings such as altogether and already, which date from much earlier). There is no logical reason for insisting that all right be two words when other single-word forms such as altogether have long been accepted. Nevertheless, although found widely, alright remains nonstandard.
