lo͞oˈtenənsē 
noun (plural lieutenancies) ORIGIN late Middle English: from Old French (see lieu, tenant) . usage: In the normal British pronunciation of lieutenant, the first syllable sounds like lef. In the standard US pronunciation, the first syllable, in contrast, sounds like loo. It is difficult to explain where the f in the British pronunciation comes from. Probably, at some point before the 19th century, the u at the end of Old French lieu was read and pronounced as a v, and the v later became an f.
