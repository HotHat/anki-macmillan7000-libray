PHRASES
different strokes for different folks proverb different things appeal to different people.DERIVATIVES differentness nounORIGIN late Middle English: via Old French from Latin different- ‘carrying away, differing,’ from the verb differre (see differ) . usage: Different from, different than, and different to: what are the distinctions between these three constructions, and is one more correct than the others? In practice, different from is both the most common structure and the most accepted. Different than is used chiefly in North America, although its use is increasing in British English. Because it can be followed by a clause, it is sometimes more concise than different from (compare "things are different than they were a year ago" with "things are different from the way they were a year ago"). Different to, although common in Britain, is disliked by traditionalists and sounds peculiar to American ears.
