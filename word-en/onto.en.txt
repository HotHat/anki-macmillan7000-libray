PHRASES
be onto someone informal be close to discovering the truth about an illegal or undesirable activity that someone is engaging in. be onto something informal have an idea or information that is likely to lead to an important discovery.usage: The preposition onto written as one word (instead of on to) is recorded from the early 18th century and has been widely used ever since. In US English, it is the regular form, although it is not wholly accepted in British English. Nevertheless, it is important to maintain a distinction between the preposition onto or on to and the use of the adverb on followed by the preposition to: she climbed onto (sometimes on to) the roof, but let's go on to (never onto) the next chapter.
