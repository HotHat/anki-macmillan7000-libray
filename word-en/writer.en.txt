A copywriter, publicist, screenwriter, historian, novelist, journalist, blogger, English teacher, rapper, diarist, or haiku poet should not experience any doubt about their professional identity.Conversational, opinionated, and idiomatic, these Word Notes are an opportunity to see a working writer's perspective on a particular word or usage.
