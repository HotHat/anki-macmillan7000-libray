Austere, on the other hand, primarily applies to people, their habits, their way of life, and the environments they create; it implies coldness, stark simplicity, and restraint (an austere room with only a table and chair). Ascetic implies extreme self-denial and self-discipline, in some cases to the point of choosing what is painful or disagreeable (he had an ascetic approach to life and rejected all creature comforts). Strict literally means bound or stretched tight; in extended use, it means strenuously exact (a strict curfew; strict obedience). Stern combines harshness and authority with strictness or severity (a stern judge). Unmitigated means unmodified and unsoftened in any way (a streak of unmitigated bad luck).These notes show fine distinctions in meaning between closely related synonyms to help you find the best word.
