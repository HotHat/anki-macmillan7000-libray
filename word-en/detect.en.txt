detect 
dəˈtekt

▶verb [with object] discover or identify the presence or existence of: cancer may soon be detected in its earliest stages. 
• discover or investigate (a crime or its perpetrators): the public can help the police to detect crime. 
• discern (something intangible or barely perceptible): Paul detected a faint note of weariness in his father's voice. ORIGIN late Middle English: from Latin detect- ‘uncovered,’ from the verb detegere, from de- (expressing reversal) + tegere ‘to cover.’ The original senses were ‘uncover, expose’ and ‘give someone away,’ later ‘expose the real or hidden nature of something or someone’; hence the current senses (partly influenced by detective).
