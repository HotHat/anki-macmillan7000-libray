adjectiveORIGIN late Middle English centre, from Old French, or from Latin centrum, from Greek kentron ‘sharp point, stationary point of a pair of compasses,’ related to kentein ‘to prick.’ usage: The construction center around (as opposed to center on, or revolve around) has been denounced as incorrect and illogical since it first appeared in the mid 19th century. Although the phrase is common, it defies geometry by confusing the orbit with the fixed point: the earth revolves around (or its revolution centers on) the sun. A careful writer will use a precise expression, such as centers on, revolves around, concerns, or involves.
