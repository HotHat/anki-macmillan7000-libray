parameter 
pəˈramədər

▶noun technical a numerical or other measurable factor forming one of a set that defines a system or sets the conditions of its operation: the transmission will not let you downshift unless your speed is within the lower gear's parameters. 
• Mathematics a quantity whose value is selected for the particular circumstances and in relation to which other variable quantities may be expressed. 
• Statistics a numerical characteristic of a population, as distinct from a statistic of a sample. 
• (in general use) a limit or boundary that defines the scope of a particular process or activity: they set the parameters of the debate. ORIGIN mid 17th century: modern Latin, from Greek para- ‘beside’ + metron ‘measure.’ usage: Until recently, use of the word parameter was confined to mathematics and related technical fields. Since around the mid 20th century, however, it has been used in nontechnical fields as a technical-sounding word for ‘a limit or boundary,’ as in they set the parameters of the debate. This use, probably influenced by the word perimeter, has been criticized for being a weakening of the technical sense. Careful writers will leave parameter to specialists in mathematics, computer science, and other technical disciplines. As a loose synonym for limit, boundary, guideline, framework, it is a vogue word that blurs more than it clarifies. Perimeter is a different word, meaning ‘border, outer boundary, or the length of such a boundary.’
