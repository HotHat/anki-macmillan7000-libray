adjective. utilizer nounORIGIN early 19th century: from French utiliser, from Italian utilizzare, from utile (see utile1) . usage: Utilize, borrowed in the 19th century from the French utiliser, means ‘make practical or effective use of.’ Because it is a more formal word than use and is often used in contexts (as in business writing) where the ordinary verb use would be simpler and more direct, utilize may strike readers as pretentious jargon and should therefore be used sparingly.
