Several twenty-something sources report that the imprecision of the term is precisely the point. From California: “It makes space for everything from what another generation might have called making out right up to full-on intercourse—that ambiguity preserves a modicum of privacy in a largely privacy-free discourse. You can tell people you've hooked up with someone without giving away all the who-did-what-to-whom.” A hookup is a casual encounter, no history, no obligations, but it can lead to something more serious.
