The adjective is so often coupled with man that the “handsome woman” never arrives in my mind without a few extra pounds and a shade of mustache. I know this ironical bent should be squared with the near-universal understanding that any handsome woman is desirable, but the most I can allow for is striking or prepossessing, and even that’s a stretch. To my idiosyncratic ear, the modifier is more damning to the poor woman than matronly.Conversational, opinionated, and idiomatic, these Word Notes are an opportunity to see a working writer's perspective on a particular word or usage.
