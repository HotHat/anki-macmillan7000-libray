A naked person who appears in a painting or photograph is said to be nude, a euphemistic but more socially acceptable term referring to the unclothed human body (in fact, the piece of art itself is called "a nude"). Bare can describe the branches of a tree as well as human limbs; it implies the absence of the conventional or appropriate covering (a bare wooden floor; bare legs; four bare walls). Bald also suggests a lack of covering, but it refers particularly to a lack of natural covering, especially hair (a bald head). Barren implies a lack of vegetation, and it also connotes destitution and fruitlessness (a barren wasteland devoid of life). A bald artist might paint a nude woman whose bare arms are extended against a barren winter landscape.These notes show fine distinctions in meaning between closely related synonyms to help you find the best word.
