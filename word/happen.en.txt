Occur can also refer either to something that comes to pass either accidentally or as planned, but it should only be used interchangeably with happen when the subject is a definite or actual event (the tragedy occurred last winter). Unlike happen, occur also carries the implication of something that presents itself to sight or mind (it never occurred to me that he was lying). Transpire is a more formal (and some would say undesirable) word meaning to happen or occur, and it conveys the sense that something has leaked out or become known (he told her exactly what had transpired while she was away). While things that happen, occur, or transpire can be either positive or negative, when something befalls it is usually unpleasant (he had no inkling of the disaster that would befall him when he got home).These notes show fine distinctions in meaning between closely related synonyms to help you find the best word.
