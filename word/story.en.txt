It's interesting how the meaning of this word has come full circle. Originally, in the 13th century, stories had to be true: the word was a synonym for 'history'—indeed, it came from Latin historia. But very soon it was applied to stories alleged to be true, and then (by the 16th century) to stories that were definitely not true. Today, the original meaning seems to be reasserting itself: I've lost track of the number of historical television programmes called "The story of something-or-other." Maybe it's time to resuscitate the verb use too: in the 16th century, there was a splendid usage: to story forth, meaning 'to proclaim the story of.' It's what happens in dictionaries and thesauruses, after all. Which reminds me of the story that Eric Partridge tells, in The Gentle Art of Lexicography, of the old lady who borrowed a dictionary from the town library. She returned it with the comment: "A very unusual book indeed—but the stories are extremely short, aren't they?"Conversational, opinionated, and idiomatic, these Word Notes are an opportunity to see a working writer's perspective on a particular word or usage.
