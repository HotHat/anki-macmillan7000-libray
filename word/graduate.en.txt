USAGE
graduate The traditional use is 'be graduated from': she will be graduated from medical school in June. However, it is now more common to say 'graduate from': she will graduate from medical school in June. The use of graduate as a transitive verb, as in he graduated high school last week, is increasingly common, especially in speech, but is considered incorrect by most traditionalists.Usage notes show additional guidance on finer points of English usage.
