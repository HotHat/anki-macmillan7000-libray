English is replete with classical tags and hackneyed phrases such as this one, but their use in writing tends to plunge any sentence into bathos. Rosy-toed Dawn might work, if you're describing a woman of this name with a dubious penchant for pink nail polish. But, in general, be wary of the wine-dark sea or the melancholy Dane or the Bard of Avon or any other phrase that comes too readily to mind. Or trippingly to the tongue, as I originally typed, and then deleted. First thoughts are all too often second-rate clichés.Conversational, opinionated, and idiomatic, these Word Notes are an opportunity to see a working writer's perspective on a particular word or usage.
