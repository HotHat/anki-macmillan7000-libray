CHOOSE THE RIGHT WORD body, cadaver, carcass, corpse, cremains, remains The problem of what to call the human body after it has departed this life is a delicate one. Although a body can be either dead or alive, human or animal, a corpse is most definitely a dead human body and a carcass is the body of a dead animal. The issue has been confused, of course, by the figurative use of carcass as a term of contempt: get your carcass out of bed and come down here! While carcass is often used humorously, there's nothing funny about corpse, a no-nonsense term for a lifeless physical body (the battlefield was littered with corpses). A funeral director is likely to prefer the term remains, which is a euphemism for the body of the deceased (he had his wife's remains shipped home for burial), or cremains, if the body has been cremated. A medical student, on the other hand, is much more likely to use the term cadaver, which is a corpse that is dissected in a laboratory for scientific study.These notes show fine distinctions in meaning between closely related synonyms to help you find the best word.
