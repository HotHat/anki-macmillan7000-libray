opera 
▶noun grand opera, light opera, musical, musical comedy, opéra bouffe, operetta.REFLECTIONS Stephin Merrittopera Opera, contrary to a commonly held view, does not mean 'a play sung through without speech,' so cutting the dialogue doesn't make a musical an opera. Rather, opera is a musical theater style in which audience comprehension of the lyrics is subordinate to purity of vocal tone. Thus opera need not be translated to be sung abroad, whereas an untranslated musical would induce catatonia. Operetta is something in between: either a comic opera, which depends on understanding the words; or a very pretty musical, whose characters are usually opera singers, which excuses any difficulty in understanding what they say.Conversational, opinionated, and idiomatic, these Word Notes are an opportunity to see a working writer's perspective on a particular word or usage.
