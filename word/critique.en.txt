critique 
▶noun a critique of North American culture: analysis, evaluation, assessment, appraisal, appreciation, criticism, review, study, commentary, exposition, exegesis.REFLECTIONS David Foster Wallacecritique I went to college in the mid-1980s, and there I got taught that there's no such verb as to critique. The professors (both around 50) who hammered this into me explained that to criticize meant 'to judge the merits and defects of, to analyze, to evaluate' and that critique (noun) was simply 'a specific critical commentary or review.' Twenty years later, though, dictionaries' primary definition of to criticize is usually 'to find fault with.' Even for educated readers, the verb is apt to have negative connotations that it didn't in 1985. This is why some usage authorities now consider to critique to be OK; they argue that it can minimize confusion by denoting the neutral, scholarly-type assessment that used to be what to criticize meant. Here's the thing, though—it's still only some usage experts who accept to critique. Dictionaries' usage panels are usually now split about 50-50 on sentences like After a run-through, the playwright and director both critiqued the actor's delivery. And it's not just authorities: a decent percentage of American readers, especially those educated before 1990, still find to critique either incorrect or annoying. Why alienate these readers if you don't have to? If you're worried that criticize will seem too deprecatory, you can say evaluate, explicate, analyze, judge … or you can always use the old bury-the-main-verb trick and do offer a critique of, submit a critique of, etc.Conversational, opinionated, and idiomatic, these Word Notes are an opportunity to see a working writer's perspective on a particular word or usage.
