USAGE
center around The construction center around (as opposed to center on or revolve around) has been denounced as incorrect and illogical since it first appeared in the mid 19th century. Although the phrase is common, it defies geometry by confusing the orbit with the fixed point. Accurately, the earth revolves around (or its revolution centers on) the sun. In a sentence such as 'Our discussion tonight centers around the issue of charter schools,' the speaker would do well to avoid the imprecise expression centers around in favor of the more appropriate centers on, revolves around, concerns, or involves .Usage notes show additional guidance on finer points of English usage.
