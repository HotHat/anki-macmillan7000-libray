How does this relate to the meaning that conveys endurance or forbearance (His tolerance for pain—or for large quantities of the experimental drug—was impressive) or the sense, employed in architecture and engineering, of allowable deviance from a standard? I've also heard the word used, informally, as a measure of physical space, most often narrow. The tolerance between the car and the walls of the alley was minuscule. Is this a helpful reminder that tolerance (in the sense of open-mindedness) may require a certain amount of flinty endurance, that it is unusual, and that it has something to do with how much room we have, with the space we are obliged to share with the neighbor whose differences we must learn to tolerate?Conversational, opinionated, and idiomatic, these Word Notes are an opportunity to see a working writer's perspective on a particular word or usage.
