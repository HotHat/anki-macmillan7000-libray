If they do, they can claim linguistic justification. Author comes from Latin auctor, originally from a verb augere 'to make grow, originate.' Actor has the same origin. Both words arrived in English in the 14th century, and their similar spellings— auctor and actour —caused them to be often confused. This may have been the reason why an h was added to the former—we find aucthour, and then author —to help distinguish the two. Author then took off, and generated a whole family of derivatives. In the 16th century, we find authorer (meaning an 'originator' of something), authorage (we say authorship today), author-craft, authorical (for modern authorial), and authoridate ('to atttribute to an author'). It's a pity some of these have gone. What else are we celebrating in a thesaurus but author-craft?Conversational, opinionated, and idiomatic, these Word Notes are an opportunity to see a working writer's perspective on a particular word or usage.
