USAGE
one, you In modern English, the use of one as a pronoun to mean ‘anyone’ or ‘me and people in general,’ as in one must try one's best, is generally restricted to formal contexts, outside which it is likely to be regarded as rather pompous or old-fashioned. In informal and spoken contexts, the normal alternative is you, as in you have to do what you can, don't you? .Usage notes show additional guidance on finer points of English usage.
