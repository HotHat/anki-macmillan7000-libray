Doubt implies both uncertainty and an inability to make a decision because the evidence is insufficient (considerable doubt as to her innocence). Dubiety comes closer in meaning to uncertainty than to doubt, because it stresses a lack of sureness rather than an inability to reach a decision; but unlike uncertainty, it connotes wavering or fluctuating between one conclusion and another (no one could fail to notice the dubiety in his voice). If you exhibit skepticism, you are not so much uncertain as unwilling to believe. It usually refers to a habitual state of mind or to a customary reaction (she always listened to his excuses with skepticism).These notes show fine distinctions in meaning between closely related synonyms to help you find the best word.
