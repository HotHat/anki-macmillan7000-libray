USAGE
last, latest In precise usage, latest means 'most recent' (my latest project is wallpapering my dining room), and last means 'final' (the last day of the school year will be June 18). But last is often used in place of latest, especially in informal contexts: I read his last novel.Usage notes show additional guidance on finer points of English usage.
