USAGE
nice Nice originally had a number of meanings, including ‘fine, subtle, discriminating’ (they are not very nice in regard to the company they keep); ‘refined in taste, hard to please, fastidious’ (for company so nice, the finest caterers would be engaged); and ‘precise, strict’ (she has a nice sense of decorum). The overuse of nice to mean ‘pleasant, agreeable, satisfactory’ (we had a very nice time; this is a nice room; he's a nice boy) has not only rendered the word rather trite, it has made it awkward to effectively use nice in the context of any of its other meanings.Usage notes show additional guidance on finer points of English usage.
