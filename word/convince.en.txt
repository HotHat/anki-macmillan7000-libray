Convince derives from a Latin word meaning 'to conquer, overcome.' Persuade derives from a Latin word meaning 'to advise, make appealing, sweeten.' One can convince or persuade someone with facts or arguments, but, in general, convincing is limited to the mind, while persuasion results in action (just as dissuasion results in nonaction): the prime minister convinced the council that delay was pointless ; the senator persuaded her colleagues to pass the legislation.These notes show fine distinctions in meaning between closely related synonyms to help you find the best word.
