evolution 
▶noun
1 the evolution of language: development, advancement, growth, rise, progress, expansion, unfolding; transformation, adaptation, modification, revision.
2 his interest in evolution: Darwinism, natural selection.REFLECTIONS Joshua Ferrisevolution Evolution implies in its most fundamental form an organism’s natural progression over the course of time, either by accident or by adaption. This is quite different from how Darwinism has come to be used, to the point that I would argue they are not really relatable. In its most fundamental form, Darwinism implies a cutthroat competition among any two things to guarantee the survival of the fittest. While an organism may evolve over time by means of some natural and self-sustaining mechanism, something locked in Darwinian struggle prevails over its terrestrial competition through shrewd, violent, and/or unnatural means. The difference has implications for certain judgments—moral, scientific, and metaphysical—we make about the world. Darwinism frequently implies an agent, usually a human one, aggressively seeking to triumph, while evolution is a process typically but not always correctly assumed to be beneficial but godless, lacking an agent. Those who might readily encourage a Darwinian wrestling match might be expected to dismiss evolution out of hand. ( The senator from Kansas engaged in a Darwinian campaign to keep evolution out of the schools.)Conversational, opinionated, and idiomatic, these Word Notes are an opportunity to see a working writer's perspective on a particular word or usage.
