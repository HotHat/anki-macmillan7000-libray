infer 
▶verb is it really possible to infer that a crime was committed, given this flimsy evidence? deduce, conclude, conjecture, surmise, reason, interpret; gather, understand, presume, assume, take it, extrapolate; read between the lines, figure (out); informal reckon.CHOOSE THE RIGHT WORD infer, imply When it comes to these two words, misuse is not uncommon, so it's important to note the distinction in their meanings. In the sentence the speaker implied that the general had been a traitor, the word implied means that something in the speaker's words ‘suggested’ that this man was a traitor (although nothing so explicit was actually stated). However, in we inferred from his words that the general had been a traitor, the word inferred means that something in the speaker's words enabled the listeners to ‘deduce’ that the man was a traitor. The two words infer and imply can describe the same event, but from different angles. Mistakes occur when infer is used to mean imply, as in are you inferring that I'm a liar? (instead of are you implying that I'm a liar? ).These notes show fine distinctions in meaning between closely related synonyms to help you find the best word.
