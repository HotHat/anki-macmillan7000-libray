USAGE
locate In formal English, one should avoid using locate to mean ‘find (a missing object)’: he can't seem to locate his keys. In precise usage, locate means ‘discover the exact place or position of’ or ‘fix the position of, put in place’: the doctors hope to locate the source of the bleeding; the studio should be located on a north-facing slope.Usage notes show additional guidance on finer points of English usage.
