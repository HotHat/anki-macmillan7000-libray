ˈhōmˌlīk 
adjectiveORIGIN Old English hām, of Germanic origin; related to Dutch heem and German Heim . usage: The traditional form for the verbal phrase meaning ‘move accurately towards a target’ is home in on, not hone in on. More than a third of citations for this expression in the Oxford English Corpus are for hone in on, however, and in the US this form has become common even in edited text. Nonetheless, hone in on is still regarded by many as incorrect, and it remains relatively rare in British use.
