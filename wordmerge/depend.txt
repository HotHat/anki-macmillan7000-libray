[with clause] : the article sneered or just condescended, depending on how you read it. it (or that) (all) depends used to express uncertainty or qualification in answering a question: How many people use each screen? It all depends.ORIGIN late Middle English ( sense 3; also in the sense ‘wait or be in suspense’): from Old French dependre, from Latin dependere, from de- ‘down’ + pendere ‘hang.’ usage: In informal use, it is quite common for the on to be dropped in sentences such as it all depends how you look at it (rather than it all depends on how you look at it), but in well-formed written English, the on should be retained. In more formal writing, and sometimes for sound, rhythm, or other rhetorical effect, upon is the preferred preposition: You may depend upon it.
