I.  ORIGIN late 19th century: from Italian, from Latin scena ‘scene.’ usage: Strictly, a scenario is ‘an outline of a plot’ or ‘a postulated sequence of events’: the worst-case scenario. It is often used loosely to mean ‘situation,’ as in a nightmare scenario, but this should be avoided in careful writing.
