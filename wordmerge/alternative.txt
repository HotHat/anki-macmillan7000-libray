USAGE
alternative, alternate
1 Alternate can be a verb, noun, or adjective, while alternative can be a noun or adjective. In both American and British English, the adjective alternate means ‘every other’ (there will be a dance on alternate Saturdays) and the adjective alternative means ‘available as another choice’ (an alternative route; alternative medicine; alternative energy sources). In American usage, however, alternate can also be used to mean ‘available as another choice’: an alternate plan called for construction to begin immediately rather than waiting for spring. Likewise, a book club may offer an alternate selection as an alternative to the main selection.
2 Some traditionalists maintain, from an etymological standpoint, that you can have only two alternatives —from the Latin alter ‘other (of two); the other’—and that uses of more than two alternatives are erroneous. Such uses are, however, normal in modern standard English.Usage notes show additional guidance on finer points of English usage.
