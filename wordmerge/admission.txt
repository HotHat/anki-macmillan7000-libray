USAGE
admission, admittance Admission traditionally refers to the price paid for entry or the right to enter (admission was $5), and admittance more often refers to physical entry (we were denied admittance by a large man with a forbidding scowl). In the sense of 'permission or right to enter,' these words have become almost interchangeable, although admittance is more formal and technical.Usage notes show additional guidance on finer points of English usage.
