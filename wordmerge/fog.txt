Seen from the air, a pogonip appears to flatten out whitely the most varied topography with the precision of a blacktop roller. From below, the word sounds just like what it means: the pogo part puts it way up there, like a leap on a pogostick, while the nip part tells you just what the fog feels like. I like it as a descriptor of a hangover—foggy, undispersible, with ice crystals in the brain—or even better, as a synonym for a hair of the dog (“I was feeling super lousy until I had that pogonip”).Conversational, opinionated, and idiomatic, these Word Notes are an opportunity to see a working writer's perspective on a particular word or usage.
