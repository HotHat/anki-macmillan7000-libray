PHRASES
bless you! said to a person who has just sneezed. [from the phrase (may) God bless you.]ORIGIN Old English blēdsian, blētsian, based on blōd ‘blood’ (i.e., originally perhaps ‘mark or consecrate with blood’). The meaning was influenced by its being used to translate Latin benedicere ‘to praise, worship,’ and later by association with bliss .
