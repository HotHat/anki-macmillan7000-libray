Rosalind: “Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do; and the reason why they are not so punish'd and cured is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too.” Shakespeare coined about half the words in modern English, why not add one more? I propose using whipper to mean 'someone helplessly implicated in the irrationality of love.'Conversational, opinionated, and idiomatic, these Word Notes are an opportunity to see a working writer's perspective on a particular word or usage.
