Machine is an exemplar of a generic word behind which resides a rich lode of specificity which, until your two-year-old becomes a tractor fanatic, you ignore entirely, content to consider it only as that idle, forlorn thing resting on the roadside as you pass by.Conversational, opinionated, and idiomatic, these Word Notes are an opportunity to see a working writer's perspective on a particular word or usage.
