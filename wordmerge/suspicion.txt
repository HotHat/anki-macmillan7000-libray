PHRASES
above suspicion too obviously good or honest to be thought capable of wrongdoing. under suspicion thought to be guilty of wrongdoing.ORIGIN Middle English: from Anglo-Norman French suspeciun, from medieval Latin suspectio(n-), from suspicere ‘mistrust.’ The change in the second syllable was due to association with Old French suspicion (from Latin suspicio(n-) ‘suspicion’).
