WORD LINKS
love amatory relating to loveWord Links sections supply words that are related to the headword but do not normally appear in a thesaurus because they are not actual synonyms.REFLECTIONS Stephin Merrittlove, lover The rhymes with love are limited to above, dove, glove, of, and shove. Romance is much better; at least it rhymes with dance. “The skies above Contain a dove Wearing the glove I'm dreaming of; To rhyme with love, Words you must shove.” So don't burden us with any more strained rhymes; either use the word in the middle of a line (I love you) or use a different word. This is why we have a thesaurus. And despite centuries of precedent, lover does not rhyme with another. In our stupid language, the only rhymable word for lover that you can really use much is beau, so let's all use it in speech every day till it sounds less dated.
