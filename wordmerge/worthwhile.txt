▶adjective worth the time, money, or effort spent; of value or importance: extra lighting would make a worthwhile contribution to road safety. DERIVATIVES worthwhileness nounusage: The adjective worthwhile is used both attributively (that is, before the noun) and predicatively (that is, when it stands alone and comes after the verb). In both positions, it is always correct as one word ( a worthwhile book; we didn't think it was worthwhile), but when used predicatively, it may also be written as two words: we didn't think it was worth while.
