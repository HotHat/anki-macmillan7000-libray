▶adverb
1 at all times; on all occasions: the sun always rises in the east. 
• throughout a long period of the past: she had always been an obstinate sort. 
• for all future time; forever: she will always be missed. 
• repeatedly and annoyingly: she is always making derogatory remarks.
2 as a last resort; failing all else: if the marriage doesn't work out, we can always get divorced. ORIGIN Middle English: genitive case of all way, the inflection probably giving the sense ‘at every time’ as opposed to ‘at one uninterrupted time’; the difference between the two is no longer distinct.
