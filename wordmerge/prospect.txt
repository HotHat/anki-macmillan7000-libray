ˈpräˌspektər prəˈspektər 
nounORIGIN late Middle English (as a noun denoting the action of looking toward a distant object): from Latin prospectus ‘view,’ from prospicere ‘look forward,’ from pro- ‘forward’ + specere ‘to look.’ Early use, referring to a view of landscape, gave rise to the meaning ‘mental picture’ (mid 16th century), whence ‘anticipated event.’
