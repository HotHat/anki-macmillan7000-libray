PHRASES
out of humor in a bad mood. sense of humor the ability to perceive humor or appreciate a joke.ORIGIN Middle English (as humour): via Old French from Latin humor ‘moisture,’ from humere (see humid). The original sense was ‘bodily fluid’ (surviving in aqueous humor and vitreous humor, fluids in the eyeball); it was used specifically for any of the cardinal humors ( sense
3 of the noun), whence ‘mental disposition’ (thought to be caused by the relative proportions of the humors). This led, in the 16th century, to the senses ‘state of mind, mood’ ( sense
2 of the noun) and ‘whim, fancy,’ hence to humor someone ‘to indulge a person's whim.’ Sense
1 of the noun dates from the late 16th century.
