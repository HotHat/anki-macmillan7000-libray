ANTONYMS serious.REFLECTIONS Alexandra Horowitzhumorous Sure, you can use humorous as a 25-cent word to mean ‘funny,’ but it is not a true equivalent. Verse may be humorous (as Ogden Nash's); jokes are, instead, funny (as Eddie Izzard's). Humorous is almost too serious a word to be used to describe some truly funny things. “Oh, but isn't that Simpsons television show humorous” is something a fan would never say. It is even wielded as a wry way to comment on the perceived-but-not-actual humor of an event or text. But this word shouldn't be shelved. As Shakespeare used it, humorous is a thing of beauty. For in its now-archaic definition, it is not a slightly off synonym, but a word without synonym. “The Duke is humorous,” a courtier warns in As You Like It. The duke is not funny; he is moody.
