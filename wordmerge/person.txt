CHOOSE THE RIGHT WORD persons, people These words can both be used as the plural of person, but they are not by custom used in exactly the same way. People is by far the more common of the two words and is used in most ordinary contexts: a group of people; there were only about ten people; several thousand people have been rehoused. Persons, on the other hand, tends now to be restricted to official or formal contexts, as in this vehicle is authorized to carry twenty persons; no persons admitted without a pass. In some contexts, persons, by pointing to the individuals, may sound less friendly than people:the number should not be disclosed to any unauthorized persons.These notes show fine distinctions in meaning between closely related synonyms to help you find the best word.
