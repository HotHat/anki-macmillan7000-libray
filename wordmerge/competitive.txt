But in fact it's come to signify, more narrowly, the struggle for survival and dominance that furthers evolution and enables a particular species to prevail over its competitors. What I like about the word is how it can also be used to describe certain unattractive sorts of human social behavior, also marked by fierce competition and by the ruthless desire for dominance: The atmosphere in the classroom—or at the dinner party—was remarkably Darwinian.Conversational, opinionated, and idiomatic, these Word Notes are an opportunity to see a working writer's perspective on a particular word or usage.
