▶noun (plural phenomena 
-nə
)

2 Philosophy the object of a person's perception; what the senses or the mind notice. ORIGIN late 16th century: via late Latin from Greek phainomenon ‘thing appearing to view,’ based on phainein ‘to show.’ usage: The word phenomenon comes from Greek, and its plural form is phenomena, as in these phenomena are not fully understood. It is a mistake to treat phenomena as if it were a singular form, as in this is a strange phenomena.
