18 holes, each set in a smooth lawn (a green) separated from the others by stretches of smooth grass (fairways), rough ground, sand-filled bunkers, and other hazards. Various clubs are used to hit the ball from a tee toward the green and then putt it into the hole.

▶verb [no object] play golf: (as noun golfing) : a week's golfing. ORIGIN late Middle English (originally Scots): perhaps related to Dutch kolf ‘club, bat,’ used as a term in several Dutch games; golf, however, is recorded before these games.
