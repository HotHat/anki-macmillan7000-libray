5 (the battery) Baseball the pitcher and the catcher in a game, considered as a unit. ORIGIN Middle English: from French batterie, from battre ‘to strike,’ from Latin battuere. The original sense was ‘metal articles wrought by hammering,’ later ‘a number of pieces of artillery used together’; on this was based a sense ‘a number of Leyden jars connected up so as to discharge simultaneously’ (mid 18th century), from which sense
1 developed. The general meaning ‘a set or series of similar units’ ( sense 3) dates from the late 19th century.
