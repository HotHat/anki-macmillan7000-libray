scissors 
ˈsizərz 
(also a pair of scissors) 
▶pl. noun an instrument used for cutting cloth, paper, and other thin material, consisting of two blades laid one on top of the other and fastened in the middle so as to allow them to be opened and closed by a thumb and finger inserted through rings on the end of their handles. 
• (also scissor) [often as modifier] an action in which two things cross each other or open and close like the blades of a pair of scissors: as the fish swims, the tail lobes open and close in a slight scissor action. ORIGIN late Middle English: from Old French cisoires, from late Latin cisoria, plural of cisorium ‘cutting instrument,’ from cis-, variant of caes-, stem of caedere ‘to cut.’ The spelling with sc- (16th century) was by association with the Latin stem sciss- ‘cut.’
