Less, on the other hand, is used with mass nouns, denoting things that cannot be counted (less money; less music). In addition, less is normally used with expressions of measurement or time (less than four miles away; less than two weeks). To use less with countable nouns, as in less people or less words, however, is incorrect in standard English.These notes show fine distinctions in meaning between closely related synonyms to help you find the best word.
