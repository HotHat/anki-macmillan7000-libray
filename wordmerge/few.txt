PHRASES

Less, on the other hand, is used with mass nouns, denoting things that cannot be counted ( less money; less music). In addition, less is normally used with numbers ( less than 10,000) and with expressions of measurement or time ( less than two weeks; less than four miles away). But to use less with count nouns, as in less people or less words, is incorrect in standard English.
