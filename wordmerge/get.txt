CHOOSE THE RIGHT WORD get, acquire, attain, gain, obtain, procure, secure Get is a very broad term meaning 'to come into possession of.' You can get something by fetching it (get some groceries), by receiving it (get a birthday gift), by earning it (get interest on a bank loan), or by any of a dozen other familiar means. It is such a common, overused word that many writers try to substitute obtain for it whenever possible, perhaps because it sounds less colloquial. But it can also sound pretentious (all employees were required to obtain an annual physical exam) and should be reserved for contexts where the emphasis is on seeking something out (to obtain blood samples). Acquire often suggests a continued, sustained, or cumulative acquisition (to acquire poise as one matures), but it can also hint at deviousness (to acquire the keys to the safe). Use procure if you want to emphasize the effort involved in bringing something to pass (procure a mediated divorce settlement) or if you want to imply maneuvering to possess something (procure a reserved parking space). But beware: Procure is so often used to describe the act of obtaining partners to gratify the lust of others (to procure a prostitute) that it has acquired somewhat unsavory overtones. Gain also implies effort, usually in getting something advantageous or profitable (gain entry; gain victory). In a similar vein, secure underscores the difficulty involved in bringing something to pass and the desire to place it beyond danger (secure a permanent peace; secure a lifeline). Attain should be reserved for achieving a high goal or desirable result (if she attains the summit of Mt. Everest, she will secure for herself a place in mountaineering history).These notes show fine distinctions in meaning between closely related synonyms to help you find the best word.
