REFLECTIONS Jean Strousehook up, hookup In the title essay of his book Hooking Up, Tom Wolfe wrote that to anyone over the age of
9 in the year 2000, the term always referred to a sexual experience, but that the “nature and extent” of the experience varied widely. Several twenty-something sources report that the imprecision of the term is precisely the point. From California: “It makes space for everything from what another generation might have called making out right up to full-on intercourse—that ambiguity preserves a modicum of privacy in a largely privacy-free discourse. You can tell people you've hooked up with someone without giving away all the who-did-what-to-whom.” A hookup is a casual encounter, no history, no obligations, but it can lead to something more serious. From New York: “My relationship with my girlfriend began with a hookup, since we'd never met before that night, and developed into a relationship. That didn't retrospectively make it not a hookup.”Conversational, opinionated, and idiomatic, these Word Notes are an opportunity to see a working writer's perspective on a particular word or usage.
