▶noun
1 the beauty of a New England autumn: fall.
2 the autumn of her life: twilight, final years, tail end.REFLECTIONS David Thomsonautumn, autumnal In America, it is called the Fall, but that is a country where a dangerous and pompous guilt tries to constrain the abundant wildness of nature. So autumnal gets too little use, and those hushed but measured syllables go to waste. This is odd, because it is the very word that begs to be given as an answer to those empty, amiable American salutes, like “Well, how are you today?” Don’t we all, sooner or later, want to reply, “Autumnal”? I remember, it’s said to be a time of “mellow fruitfulness,” but I never loved the word more than in those sudden premonitions of bleak New England winters when autumnal was so suited to golden crisp leaves that shattered if you picked them up.Conversational, opinionated, and idiomatic, these Word Notes are an opportunity to see a working writer's perspective on a particular word or usage.
