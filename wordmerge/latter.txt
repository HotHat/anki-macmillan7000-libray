▶adjective [attributive]

heart disease dogged his latter years. 
• recent: the project had low cash flows in its latter years.
2 (the latter) denoting the second or second mentioned of two people or things: the Russians could advance into either Germany or Austria—they chose the latter option. ORIGIN Old English lætra ‘slower,’ comparative of læt (see late) . usage: Latter means ‘the second-mentioned of two.’ Its use to mean ‘the last-mentioned of three or more’ is common, but is considered incorrect by some because latter means ‘later’ rather than ‘latest.’ Last or last-mentioned is preferred where three or more things are involved.
