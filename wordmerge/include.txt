▶verb
1 activities include sports and drama: incorporate, comprise, encompass, cover, embrace, involve, take in, number, contain; consist of, be made up of, be composed of; formal comprehend. ANTONYMS exclude.
2 don't forget to include the cost of repairs: allow for, count, take into account, take into consideration. ANTONYMS omit, leave out.CHOOSE THE RIGHT WORD include, comprise Include has a broader meaning than comprise. In the sentence the accommodations comprise two bedrooms, bathroom, kitchen, and living room, the word comprise implies that there are no accommodations other than those listed. Include can be used in this way, too, but it is also used in a nonrestrictive way, implying that there may be other things not specifically mentioned that are part of the same category, as in the price includes a special welcome pack. Careful writers will avoid superfluous uses of “including … and more,” commonly found in advertising. The “and more” is superfluous because including or includes implies that there is more than what is listed.These notes show fine distinctions in meaning between closely related synonyms to help you find the best word.
