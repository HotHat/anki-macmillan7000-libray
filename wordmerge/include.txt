• allow (someone) to share in an activity or privilege: there were doubts as to whether she was included in the invitation. ORIGIN late Middle English (also in the sense ‘shut in’): from Latin includere, from in- ‘into’ + claudere ‘to shut.’ usage: Include has a broader meaning than comprise. In the sentence the accommodations comprise two bedrooms, bathroom, kitchen, and living room, the word comprise implies that there are no accommodations other than those listed. Include can be used in this way too, but it is also used in a nonrestrictive way, implying that there may be other things not specifically mentioned that are part of the same category, as in the price includes a special welcome pack. Careful writers will avoid superfluous uses of ‘including . . . and more,’ commonly imitated from advertising. The ‘and more’ is superfluous because including or includes implies that there is more than what is listed.
