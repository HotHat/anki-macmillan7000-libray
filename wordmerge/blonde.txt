USAGE
blond, blonde The spellings blonde and blond correspond to the feminine and masculine forms in French. Although the distinction is often retained in Britain, American usage since the 1970s has generally preferred the gender-neutral blond. The adjective blonde may still refer to a woman's (but not a man's) hair color, although use of the noun risks offense (see that blonde over there? ): the offense arises from the fact that the color of hair is not the person. The adjective applied to inanimate objects (such as wood or beer) is typically spelled blond .Usage notes show additional guidance on finer points of English usage.
