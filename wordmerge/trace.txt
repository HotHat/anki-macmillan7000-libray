A track is a line or a series of marks left by the passage of something or someone; it often refers specifically to a line of footprints or a path worn into the ground by the feet (to follow the track of a grizzly bear). Trace may refer to a line or a rut made by someone or something that has been present or passed by; it may also refer to a mark serving as evidence that something has happened or been there (traces of mud throughout the house; the telephoto shots have a trace of camera shake). Trail may refer to the track created by the passage of animals or people, or to the mark or marks left by something being dragged along a surface (they followed the trail of the injured dog). Vestige and remnant come closer in meaning to trace, as they refer to what remains after something has passed away. A vestige is always slight when compared to what it recalls (the last vestiges of a great civilization), while a remnant is a fragment or scrap of something (all that remained of the historic tapestry after the fire were a few scorched remnants).These notes show fine distinctions in meaning between closely related synonyms to help you find the best word.
