It has a more specific definition, however; that of sexual activity 'perceived as exercise.' Of all the pointless mid-twentieth-century additions to our workout vocabularies, this is the most worthy of continuation in the language.Conversational, opinionated, and idiomatic, these Word Notes are an opportunity to see a working writer's perspective on a particular word or usage.
