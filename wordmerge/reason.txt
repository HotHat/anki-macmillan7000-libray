ˈrēz(ə)nər 
noun. reasonless 
ˈrēz(ə)nləs 
adjective ( archaic)ORIGIN Middle English: from Old French reisun (noun), raisoner (verb), from a variant of Latin ratio(n-), from the verb reri ‘consider.’ usage:
1 The construction the reason why … has been objected to on the grounds that the subordinate clause should express a statement, using a that -clause, not imply a question with a why -clause: the reason (that) I decided not to phone, rather than the reason why I decided not to phone. The reason why has been called a redundancy to be avoided, but it is a mild one, and idiomatic.
2 An objection is also made to the construction the reason … is because, as in the reason I didn't phone is because my mother has been ill. The objection is made on the grounds that either “because” or “the reason” is redundant; it is better to use the word that instead ( the reason I didn't phone is that …) or rephrase altogether ( I didn't phone because …).Nevertheless, both the above usages are well established and, although they may be inelegant, they are generally accepted in standard English.
