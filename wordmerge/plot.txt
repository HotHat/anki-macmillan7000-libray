If you get other people or groups involved in your plot, it's called a conspiracy (a conspiracy to overthrow the government). Cabal usually applies to a small group of political conspirators (a cabal of right-wing extremists), while machination (usually plural) suggests deceit and cunning in devising a plot intended to harm someone (the machinations of the would-be assassins). An intrigue involves more complicated scheming or maneuvering than a plot and often employs underhanded methods in an attempt to gain one's own ends (she had a passion for intrigue, particularly where romance was involved).These notes show fine distinctions in meaning between closely related synonyms to help you find the best word.
