It can convey a wide range of emotion, from pleasure, approval, or amusement to insincerity and disinterest (his complaint was met with a blank smile). A grin is a wide smile that suggests spontaneous cheerfulness, warmth, pleasure, or amusement (her teasing provoked an affectionate grin). But grin may also describe a ferocious baring of the teeth or an angry grimace (the grin of a skeleton). A simper, on the other hand, is an expression of smugness and self-righteousness (her simper of superiority) as well as a silly or affected smile (she curtsied with a girlish simper). Smirk also implies an affected or self-conscious smile, but one that expresses derision or hostility (to trick someone and then smirk as he makes a fool of himself).These notes show fine distinctions in meaning between closely related synonyms to help you find the best word.
