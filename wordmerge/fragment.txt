But how did the whole come apart? Fragment suggests that breakage has occurred (fragments of the vase) and often refers to a brittle substance such as glass or pottery. Segment suggests that the whole has been separated along natural or pre-existing lines of division (a segment of an orange), and section suggests a substantial and clearly separate part that fits closely with other parts to form the whole (a section of the bookcase). Fraction usually suggests a less substantial but still clearly delineated part (a fraction of her income), and a portion is a part that has been allotted or assigned to someone (her portion of the program). Finally, the very frequently used piece is any part that is separate from the whole (we're missing two pieces from the jigsaw puzzle).These notes show fine distinctions in meaning between closely related synonyms to help you find the best word.
