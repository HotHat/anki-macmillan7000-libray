3 a royal right (now especially over minerals) granted by a sovereign to an individual or corporation. 
• a payment made by a producer of minerals, oil, or natural gas to the owner of the site or of the mineral rights over it. ORIGIN late Middle English: from Old French roialte, from roial (see royal). The sense ‘royal right (especially over minerals)’ (late 15th century) developed into the sense ‘payment made by a mineral producer to the site owner’ (mid 19th century), which was then transferred to payments for the use of patents and published materials.
