▶pronoun every person: everybody agrees with his views 
it's not everybody's cup of tea. usage: Everybody, along with everyone, traditionally uses a singular pronoun of reference: everybody must sign his own name. Because the use of his in this context is now perceived as sexist by some, a second option became popular: everybody must sign his or her own name. But his or her is often awkward, and many feel that the plural simply makes more sense: everybody must sign their own name. Although this violates what many consider standard, it is in fact standard in British English and increasingly so in US English. In some sentences, only they makes grammatical sense: everybody agreed to convict the defendant, and they voted unanimously.
