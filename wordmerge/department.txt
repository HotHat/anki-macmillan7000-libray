▶noun a division of a large organization such as a government, university, business, or shop, dealing with a specific subject, commodity, or area of activity: the English department. 
• an administrative district in France and other countries. 
• (one's department) informal an area of special expertise or responsibility: that's not my department. 
• [with modifier] informal a specified aspect or quality: I never thought of myself as above average in the looks department. ORIGIN late Middle English: from Old French departement, from departir (see depart). The original sense was ‘division or distribution,’ later ‘separation,’ hence ‘a separate part’ (core sense, mid 18th century).
