nounORIGIN late Middle English: from Latin incredibilis, from in- ‘not’ + credibilis (see credible) . usage: Believability is at the heart of both incredible and incredulous, but there is an important distinction in the respective uses of these two adjectives. Incredible means ‘unbelievable’ or ‘not convincing’ and can be applied to a situation, statement, policy, or threat to a person: I find this testimony incredible. Incredulous means ‘disinclined to believe, skeptical’—the opposite of credulous, gullible —and is usually applied to a person's attitude: you shouldn't be surprised that I'm incredulous after all your lies.
