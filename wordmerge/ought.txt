▶modal verb (third singular present and past ought) [with infinitive]
1 used to indicate duty or correctness, typically when criticizing someone's actions: they ought to respect the law 
it ought not to be allowed. 
• used to indicate a desirable or expected state: he ought to be able to take the initiative. 
• used to give or ask advice: you ought to go.
2 used to indicate something that is probable: five minutes ought to be enough time. ORIGIN Old English āhte, past tense of āgan ‘owe’ (see owe) . usage: The verb ought is a modal verb, which means that, grammatically, it does not behave like ordinary verbs. In particular, the negative is formed with the word not by itself, without auxiliary verbs such as do or have. Thus the standard construction for the negative is he ought not to go. Note that the preposition to is required in both negative and positive statements: we ought to accept her offer, or we ought not to accept her offer (not we ought accept or we ought not accept). The alternative forms he didn't ought to have gone and he hadn't ought to have gone, formed as if ought were an ordinary verb rather than a modal verb, are not acceptable in formal English. Reserve ought for expressing obligation, duty, or necessity, and use should for expressing suitability or appropriateness.
