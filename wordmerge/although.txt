▶conjunction in spite of the fact that; even though: although the sun was shining it wasn't that warm 
although small, the room has a spacious feel. 
• however; but: he says he has the team jersey, although I've never seen him wear it. ORIGIN Middle English: from all (as an adverb) + though . usage: Although and though are interchangeable in the senses listed above, the only difference being that use of though tends to be less formal than that of although. In formal writing, although tends to sound better than though as the opening word of a sentence. Some uses of though, however, are not interchangeable with although—e.g., adverbial uses ( it was nice of him to phone, though) and uses in conjunction with ‘as’ or ‘even’ ( she doesn't look as though she's listening).
