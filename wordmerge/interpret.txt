adverbORIGIN late Middle English: from Old French interpreter or Latin interpretari ‘explain, translate,’ from interpres, interpret- ‘agent, translator, interpreter.’ usage: Interpretative, which means ‘serving to interpret or explain,’ dates back to around 1560, but the shorter form interpretive, about a hundred years younger, is steadily pressing it out of employment. They mean the same thing, and both are correct. The traditional interpretative is still the preferred form in Britain, but in American usage, interpretive is far more common.
