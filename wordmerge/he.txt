▶pronoun [third person singular] used to refer to a man, boy, or male animal previously mentioned or easily identified: everyone liked my father—he was the perfect gentleman. 
• used to refer to a person or animal of unspecified sex (in modern use, now chiefly replaced by “he or she” or “they”): every child needs to know that he is loved. 
• any person (in modern use, now chiefly replaced by “anyone” or “the person”): he who is silent consents. 
▶noun [in singular] a male; a man: is that a he or a she? 
• [in combination] male: a he-goat. ORIGIN Old English he, hē, of Germanic origin; related to Dutch hij . usage:
1 For a discussion of I am older than he versus I am older than him, see usage at personal pronoun and than.2 Until recently, he was used to refer to a person of unspecified sex, as in every child needs to know that he is loved, but this is now generally regarded as old-fashioned or sexist. Since the 18th century, they has been an alternative to he in this sense, where it occurs after an indefinite pronoun such as everyone or someone ( everyone needs to feel that they matter). It is becoming more and more accepted both in speech and in writing, and is used as the norm in this dictionary. Another alternative is he or she, though this can become tiresomely long-winded when used frequently. See also usage at she, they, and everybody .
