• (Tuesdays) on Tuesdays; each Tuesday: she works late Tuesdays. ORIGIN Old English Tīwesdæg ‘day of Tīw,’ a Germanic god of war and the sky; translation of Latin dies Marti ‘day of Mars,’ the god Tīw being equated with the Roman god Mars. Compare with Swedish tisdag . The days of the week in ancient Rome were named after the planets, which in turn were named after gods. In most cases the Germanic names substituted the name of a comparable Germanic god for the Roman god's name.
