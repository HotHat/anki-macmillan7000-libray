▶noun a large open-air fire used as part of a celebration, for burning trash, or as a signal. ORIGIN late Middle English: from bone + fire. The term originally denoted a large open-air fire on which bones were burned (sometimes as part of a celebration), also one for burning heretics or proscribed literature. Dr. Johnson accepted the mistaken idea that the word came from French bon ‘good.’
