thigh 
▶noun a benign tumor in his thigh: upper leg, thigh bone; Anatomy femur, proximal segment.REFLECTIONS David Thomsonthighs Etymologists say thighs comes from old English, but maybe it was just a guy with a lisp who wanted to talk about the size of your sighs. What other part of the body works harder—all bone, all muscle?—yet stays so smooth and fleshly, so carnal? It is the engine of walking and the mechanism of balance, but where the thighs meet—the bridge of thighs—is the source of wonderment and attraction, the axis and X of creation. As the thighs open—in walking and in sex—we are at our essence, and all of us are likely to acquire an awed lisp, a miraculous mis-speak, a Freudian slip. Anyone who has ever separated thighs with a hand—their own or those of others—knows what it might be like to find lightness in the dark.Conversational, opinionated, and idiomatic, these Word Notes are an opportunity to see a working writer's perspective on a particular word or usage.
