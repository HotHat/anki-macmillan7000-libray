• experience difficulties before achieving success: this drummer has paid his dues with the best.ORIGIN Middle English (in the sense ‘payable’): from Old French deu ‘owed,’ based on Latin debitus ‘owed,’ from debere ‘owe.’ usage: The use of due to as a prepositional phrase meaning ‘because of,’ as in he had to retire due to an injury first appeared in print in 1897, and traditional grammarians have opposed this prepositional usage for more than a century on the grounds that it is a misuse of the adjectival phrase due to in the sense of ‘attributable to, likely or expected to’ ( the train is due to arrive at 11:15), or ‘payable or owed to’ ( render unto Caesar what is due to Caesar). Nevertheless, this prepositional usage is now widespread and common in all types of literature and must be regarded as standard English.The phrase due to the fact that is very common in speech, but it is wordy, and, especially in writing, one should use the simple word ‘because.’
