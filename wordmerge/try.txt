Sense
1 of the noun dates from the early 17th century. usage: In practice, there is little discernible difference in meaning between try to plus infinitive ( we should try to help them) and try and plus infinitive ( we should try and help them), but there is a difference in formality, with try to being regarded as more formal than try and. Beyond the issue of formality, the construction try and is grammatically odd, in that it cannot be inflected for tense—that is, sentences like she tried and fix it or they are trying and renew their visa are not acceptable, while their equivalents she tried to fix it or they are trying to renew their visa obviously are. For this reason, try and is best regarded as a fixed idiom used only in its infinitive and imperative form. See also usage at and .
