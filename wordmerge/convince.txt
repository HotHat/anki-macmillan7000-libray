DERIVATIVES convincer noun. convincible adjectiveORIGIN mid 16th century (in the sense ‘overcome, defeat in argument’): from Latin convincere, from con- ‘with’ + vincere ‘conquer.’ Compare with convict . usage: Although it is common to see convince and persuade used interchangeably, there are distinctions in meaning that careful writers and speakers try to preserve. Convince derives from a Latin word meaning ‘conquer, overcome.’ Persuade derives from a Latin word meaning ‘advise, make appealing, sweeten.’ One can convince or persuade someone with facts or arguments, but, in general, convincing is limited to the mind, while persuasion results in action (just as dissuasion results in nonaction): the prime minister convinced the council that delay was pointless; the senator persuaded her colleagues to pass the legislation.
