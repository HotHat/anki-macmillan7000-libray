• (Wednesdays) on Wednesdays; each Wednesday: Wednesdays, the jazz DJ hosts a jam session. ORIGIN Old English Wōdnesdæg ‘day of Odin,’ named after the Germanic god Odin or Woden, the supreme god; translation of late Latin Mercurii dies, Odin being equated with the Roman god Mercury. Compare with Dutch woensdag . The days of the week in ancient Rome were named after the planets, which in turn were named after gods. In most cases the Germanic names substituted the name of a comparable Germanic god for the Roman god's name.
