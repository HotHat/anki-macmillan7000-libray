rəˈd(y)o͞osər 
nounORIGIN late Middle English: from Latin reducere, from re- ‘back, again’ + ducere ‘bring, lead.’ The original sense was ‘bring back’ (hence ‘restore,’ now surviving in sense 5); this led to ‘bring to a different state,’ then ‘bring to a simpler or lower state’ ( sense 3); and finally ‘diminish in size or amount’ ( sense 1, dating from the late 18th century).
