If you're sexy, you've got it all. However, be careful when using this revealing adjective: It allows others a peek into your unclothed psyche. Sexiness, after all, takes myriad forms—from a Victoria's Secret model wearing nothing but a come-hither smile and a few wisps of silk to the sullen James Dean wannabe in faded denim and snugly muscled T-shirt. Out in the world, power, money, and high social position are all sexy, but in the dark, so are submission, surrender, and obedience.
