PHRASES
too clever by half informal annoyingly proud of one's intelligence or skill and in danger of overreaching oneself.ORIGIN Middle English (in the sense ‘quick to catch hold,’ only recorded in this period): perhaps of Dutch or Low German origin, and related to cleave2. In the late 16th century the term came to mean (probably through dialect use) ‘manually skillful’; the sense ‘possessing mental agility’ dates from the early 18th century.
