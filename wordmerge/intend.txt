Although mean can also imply either a firm resolve (I mean to go, with or without her permission) or a vague intention (I've been meaning to write her for weeks), it is a less formal word that usually connotes a certain lack of determination or a weak resolve. Plan, like mean and intend, may imply a vague goal (I plan to tour China some day), but it is often used to suggest that you're taking active steps (I plan to leave as soon as I finish packing). Aim indicates that you have an actual goal or purpose in mind and that you're putting some effort behind it (she had aimed to become a psychiatrist ), without the hint of failure conveyed by mean. If you propose to do something, you declare your intention ahead of time (I propose that we set up a meeting next week), and if you purpose to do it, you are even more determined to achieve your goal (I purpose to write a three-volume history of baseball in America). Design suggests forethought in devising a plan (design a strategy that will keep everyone happy).These notes show fine distinctions in meaning between closely related synonyms to help you find the best word.
