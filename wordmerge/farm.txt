ˈfärməb(ə)l 
adjectiveORIGIN Middle English: from Old French ferme, from medieval Latin firma ‘fixed payment,’ from Latin firmare ‘fix, settle’ (in medieval Latin ‘contract for’), from firmus ‘constant, firm’; compare with firm2. The noun originally denoted a fixed annual amount payable as rent or tax; this is reflected in sense
3 of the verb, which later gave rise to ‘to subcontract’ ( sense
2 of the verb). The noun came to denote a lease, and, in the early 16th century, land leased specifically for farming. The verb sense ‘grow crops or keep livestock’ dates from the early 19th century.
