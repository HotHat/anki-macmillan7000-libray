▶conjunction
1 while we waited, the weather only worsened: during the time that, when, as; chiefly British whilst.
2 while the research is important, there are other financial considerations: although, notwithstanding (the fact) that, even though, even if, for all that; chiefly British whilst.REFLECTIONS Michael Dirdawhilst Whilst is hardly ever used in American writing (it's still relatively common in Britain), and copyeditors will always change it to while. But this is too bad. Whilst shares with certain other nearly archaic words— relict and whilom, for example—an attractive period flavor. It calls to mind keepsake albums, rose bowers, and afternoon tea. Forgotten Edwardian novels might well open with sentences like “Whilst Lady Gwendolen …”—and the modern reader can immediately descry, if ever so faintly, the red velvet settee upon which the pouting young girl reclines, quietly sulking because Reginald is late again with the landau. Certainly every good writer should strive to keep alive at least a few odd and endangered words like whilst.Conversational, opinionated, and idiomatic, these Word Notes are an opportunity to see a working writer's perspective on a particular word or usage.
